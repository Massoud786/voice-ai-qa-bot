# Voice AI QA Harness

End-to-end voice testing harness that simulates patient calls, records conversations, generates transcripts, and evaluates conversational quality using AI.

## 🚀 Overview

Voice AI QA Harness is a backend service that integrates with Twilio to:

- Receive live voice calls via webhook
- Record and download audio files
- Transcribe conversations using OpenAI
- Evaluate call quality using structured AI scoring
- Detect potential PII exposure
- Expose analytics via REST API

The system stores structured artifacts per call:

outputs/<CallSid>/
- patient.wav
- transcript.txt
- evaluation.json

--- 

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Modern AI voice systems require automated quality monitoring, structured scoring, and compliance detection. This project simulates a production-style QA pipeline used for conversational AI testing and monitoring.
